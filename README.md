### A Django Webapp to build AI Image Classifier Models without coding

#### Implementations:
- Upload data (only csv formats contains images, labels collumn, images must have 3 dimesions)
- Data Loading and Preprocessing
- Transfer Learning (resnet, vgg, alexnet, inception, densenet, squeezenet
- Save models
- User authentication, private, public data

#### TO DO:
- Showing live logs during training
- Store training History, create user dashboard
- Create inference for each model
- Data format independent platform
- Data preprocessing, training user options (hyper-parameters tunining options)
- Implement more machine learning algorithms, generalized cnn architectures

##### ** Limitations: 
- Limited input formats, Can only take csv files, images with 3 dimensions
- Training resource, Storage resource, Time complexity etc.
